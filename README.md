# Photomosaic

This project is used to generate photomosaics - a grid of smaller images that overall resembles a larger image.

For more details, `overview.md` contains a breakdown of the photomosaic generation process.

## Generating a photomosaic

A JSON must be constructed containing the full set of parameters for the photomosaic. Details on how the JSON should be constructed are in `overview.md`.
